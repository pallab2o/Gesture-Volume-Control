# Gesture Volume Control

Gesture Volume Control is a Python project that allows users to adjust their computer's volume using hand gestures. This project utilizes computer vision and hand tracking techniques to detect and interpret hand movements, enabling users to control volume levels with intuitive gestures.

## How It Works

Gesture Volume Control captures live video feed from the computer's camera and processes each frame using OpenCV and Mediapipe libraries. The system identifies the landmarks of the user's hand and analyzes specific gestures, such as moving the hand up or down, to adjust the volume accordingly.

## Features

- Adjust computer volume using hand gestures
- Real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition
- Intuitive and hands-free operation
- Easily customizable parameters for gesture detection

## Installation

To run Gesture Volume Control on your system, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the `VolumeHandControl.py` script.

## Usage

Once the project is running, position your hand in front of the camera and perform the specified gestures to control the volume. Experiment with different gestures and observe how they affect the volume levels.

## Acknowledgements

- This project was inspired by the tutorials and resources provided by FreeCodeCamp.
- Special thanks to the contributors of the OpenCV and Mediapipe libraries for their valuable work in the field of computer vision.
